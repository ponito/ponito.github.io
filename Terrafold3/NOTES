You are a colonization simulation
Stabilize with more and more people
When you stabilize, your next cap of people is doubled based on your population growth
You have a number of cryogenic pods to unfreeze, and population growth from there

It's as if you landed on a peaceful planet with alien flora and fauna
Your ship has basic automata, you have cryogenic pods to unfreeze an adult

You have a queue of actions. You perform the front of the queue.
One second is 20 ticks

Start with 0/1 people
Start with 10/10 robots
To stabilize:
food, water, resources, shelter, software, max people
New Simulation
Requirements
At least max people
Shelter for #max people
People have 100% purpose
2x food req per person OR don't starve for 10 minutes
2x water req per person OR don't thirst for 10 minutes
Restart:
Reset everything except software
Double the # of frozen people

ACTION universals
[ ] Until Empty OR
[ ] For X times
[ ] Re-add to Queue when done

People:
Upkeep every minute
-1 food per person
-10 clean water per person

Food
Identify Fauna
Progress bar gets added to the front depending on action
Using robots:
ACTION Send Robot to observe animals - 2s
-1 Robot
+1 Fauna Info per second
Computer:
ACTION Process Fauna Info - 10s
Fauna Info -100
Useful Fauna Info +1
Each simulation has 1+ animals in each size, more as the game progresses
Each animal has 5-10 pieces of info
Gives bonuses later (maybe)
Need all pieces of info to hunt
Always there info
Meat
Speed
Difficulty
Population (regenerates .01% of current +.0001 per second)
It's significantly harder to identify the next one of the same size
Choose which size to look for
Sizes
Small - difficulty 1
Medium - difficulty 2
Large - difficulty 4
In general, large are reliable, small have crazier bonuses
Hunt Fauna
Only for fauna with all info found
Using robots:
ACTION Send Robot to hunt for <fauna type> (available per fauna) - 2s
-1 Robot
Kills 1 animal every <difficulty>*10s
-1 <fauna type> population
+1 <fauna type> corpse
ACTION Set Robot to Process Fauna - 2s
-1 Robot
Processes a fauna every <difficulty>*5s - starts at lowest difficulty
Efficiency starts at 10%. Meat is decimals, others are whole numbers.
Potential gains:
Soft Materials (clothing)
Dense Materials (building)
Using people:
ACTION Cook Meat
1/X people
-3 meat/10 sec
+1 food/10 sec
