Lake 2
    Purpose: get oxygen from electricity
Irrigate to redirect water
Plants take groundwater, carbon dioxide, and produce oxygen, putting water in atmosphere (transpiration)

    Farm
    repair farm bot - 100 iron
    Place dirt - cbots
        Show baseLand, (max land), efficiency %
        land as resource above

    Spread dirt -> land - fbots (optimize)
    plant seeds (fbots)
        puts seeds around land
    water plants (fbots)
        adds constant amount to groundwater
        plants absorb at a linear rate
        groundwater goes back into lake
        plants have a lifespan and effectiveness
        effectivness drops if no water
        plants take CO2 from localAtmo, send O2 + H2O into atmo/clouds (transpiration)

    Steel Plant
    Smelt Steel
        Uses O2 + iron, gives steel
    Weld Farm Bot
        Uses 10 cbots + steel + O2, gives f.bot

Lake 3
    Purpose: hold sponsorship (rebirth) features, sponsorship button, unique upgrades that unlock/get better through resetting



    Sponsorship - new featuers, you get 5x the cash you've built up to now,
        Milking it timer - You have up to 5 minutes to get more resources before you're forced to reset. You can reset early
        Gives you sellout points, each to unlock the next sponsorship feature (or upgrade it)


        sponsorship types, unlocked if you pass certain thresholds - using one makes it's efficiency % goes down by 75, with a very, very slow regen time, gives sellout points basd on sqrt of what you choose
            water
                using estimate of 100k water by then, log2 = 16, sqrt = 316, sqrt(200k) = 447
            cash
            ore
            iron
            steel
            c.bots








        requires from upgrades - water total goes up by at least 2x each reset. Costs 200 to start, 2x effect upgrades for 3x price each time, takes 2 hr, x4 hr each time, show how much % you get per second

                Num Left
                    previous to this, you could only set On or Off

    aerate water - uses co2, elec

Lake 4
    way harder than lake 3 - let users sit on reincarnate cycle for a bit, let their %s build



    Purpose: get population, scrip from electricity

Lake 5
    Purpose: get happiness from electricity

Lake 6
    Purpose: science

Lake 7
    Purpose: industry

Lake 8
    Purpose: military

FIN

need:
use endless c.bots w/o elec
OR limit c.bots

possible science upgrades:
    volcano lasts longer
    reduce how much pressure builds in volcano
    more co2/water in volcano
    river transfers faster
    stronger wind
