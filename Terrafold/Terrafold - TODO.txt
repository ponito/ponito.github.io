the space station gives me way less ice/dirt then it actually says it does

collect ships when sector is done
	if target is home and fuel is positive,

Potential later upgrades:
	Increase max # of mines per planet, make it choosable down to 1




400 ore per tick is reasonable to obtain -- 200 mines, 200 robots, etc.
5 dirt in 500 ticks would be 1 in 10 ticks, or .1 per tick -- that's half of what the space station sends you. That's probably low. 250 ticks would be on par with the space station.
So 400 ore per tick, 250 ticks per 5 dirt would be my recommendation.

Planets only have a small amount of dirt to send. So, you only mine enough ore for 2 construction bots, and those two bots build the solar panels to power the coil gun.
Strictly short term function
Yea, the whole "conquer the solar system" can use an improvement. Be nice to be able to spread your farms / etc to other planets. Real planets, that don't leak as much
Does stopsign read this and take notes? Are our ideas going into the void?

So, giving another go-round. And, I'm paying attention to details this time.
Happyness is a straight multiplier to your production. Without increasing your water consumption.
Improving farms increases your production, at the cost of increasing your water consumption.
10 pop is a base production of .1, or 100 ticks (10 secs) to produce your population.
So, eat 0.01 food, produce 0.01 output, is the base farm behavior
... So, if I'm understanding this: 1 water turns into 1 food, which turns into 1 unit of production ($1 or 1 sci).
Which means, early game, I can sell water for $2, or I can farm for less unless I'm pushing happyness/improving the house.
... That is not what I expected to find out.
Farms/ people is a bad way to go unless you are pushing happyness. Hmm.
More profitable to sell ice after all.
(at least early on)

Yea, 8000 farms, barely 83k trees -- and this is a massively space-dirt-enhanced world -- and I can barely send 2 ships for no where near enough, maybe doing 1 point of damage to the first world, which I was lucky enough to get near me.
I think comets/asteroids need to be tuned down; water needed (and farms needed) needs to go way, way down, minerals into dirt needs to be viable, and planets ...
maybe the first system you are in has small planets, not much atmosphere, not even highly habited/defended, your second system has bigger and defended planets,
and if you keep going after that, then you lose the ice market, and are relying on intra-galactic transport of ice from the various systems you've conquered ...
and why/how are you able to make interstellar drives from what is basically leftover junk tossed together in a hurry with a small number of cryogenically frozen seed people and a rapid birth rate?
Oh, no, no, no -- I finally realize what you are.
You're trimps! Very high reproduction rate. Ability to cobble together these space stations / interstellar portals. High desire to fight.

... I can't find it. For the ice, I was thinking that each ice upgrade would be +1 + 0.1%, or something like that -- a small constatn for the early game, and a percentage upgrade for late game

To support 1,000 water on the farms, you need 1m ice, which needs 100m ice in the space station.
That's what it takes with no ice market to even consider attacking planets
So with a LOT of land (333k total land), which is 97% optimized with 10k dirt in orbit, 307k trees, 500 farms @ 23.5% efficiency, I am making  30.7k oxygen/sec, and 24.5k science/sec, or just over 1 battery per sec.
The question is, how long before I can get 100m ice in the space station.
And, how in the heck can the ice market supply such crazy levels of ice? Are they depositing comets on my doorstep? ... I'm currently at 1897 per tick, so that's a comet every 2 minutes.
Yea, end-game requires way too much water.
